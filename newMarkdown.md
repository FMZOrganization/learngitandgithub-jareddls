# New Markdown File

I've finished this course.

## Things I learned or are still confused about

- I knew most of this before just from previous experience.
- Issues are a topic on there that I have not fully explored myself yet.
- I have not done too many pull requests, so it was confusing at first to get started.

## What I would like to see more of

- Maybe a tutorial on Git itself and how to use it with GitHub. (Aside from the resources given on the page)
- I personally use GitHub Desktop, since it is easier to use than Git, but would be nice to know how to use both.
